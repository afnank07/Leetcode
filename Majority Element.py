"""
Moore's Voting Algorithm:
This will work only if the following condition satisfies, "The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times."
Here, you take an element and increment the counter as you find similar ele and decrement if you find dissimilar elements. 
And if the above condition satifies, at the end of it you'll have Majority element.
